We are using Fast RCNNI on images taken from satallite imaging of coal mines and a boundry is drawn to surround it , then a boundry is drawn representing the area alloted to company for mining . If the area of mine is greater then the aloted area then it represents the area which is illegaly mined then this information can be passed to the respective authorities.
